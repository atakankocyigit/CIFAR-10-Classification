# CIFAR-10 Image Classification
The purpose of the project is to make a image classification with CNN on the CIFAR-10 data set. In addition, it has been observed how data augmentation has an effect. After performing data augmentation, the effect of parameters and layers on the model is shown. Different methods have been followed to prevent overfit. As a result, 7 different models were created and the success of these models on the test set was compared at the end.

### Libraries used in the project:
